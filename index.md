I am a PhD student in the [JSK Lab](http://www.jsk.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/) at the University of Tokyo, Japan. My research focuses on the intersection of planning and learning in robotics. Specifically, I believe that learning the feasibility (capability) of an action is crucial for robot motion generation. In light of this belief, a [recently posted preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02968) addresses the plannability-speed trade-off in motion planning, leveraging learned feasibility via classifiers. [Another RA-L article](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9406349) defines a robot's feasible "error" region and optimizes the motion parameter to maximize this region through the robot's trial-and-error. The motion with the learned parameter is thus robust to the recognition error of the robot's environment.

Before starting my PhD, I studied aerospace engineering for my B.Eng and M.Eng. Some of my works from that time are included in my [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aw4sCFsAAAAJ&hl=ja&oi=ao) profile.
